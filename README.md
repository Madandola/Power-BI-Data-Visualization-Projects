This exercise was one of the project I completed during my Bootcamp training with JustIT. It presents a high-level overview of sales and profit performance across multiple dimensions, category, segment, year, and country, based on the visual analytics displayed in the dashboard. The insights derived from this data are intended to support strategic decision-making, identify growth opportunities, and highlight areas requiring attention within the business.

## Power BI sales analysis report for Adventure Works (2018 to 2020)

The Adventure Works was another Power BI data visualization project completed during my Bootcamp with JustIT. This Analysis reports provide a comprehensive sales performance, profit margins, and inventory trends from FY2019 to FY2020.

The dashboard from Adventure Works for FY2020, showing sales performance and product category distribution across regions and months.
Sales and Profit Margin by Month

A, Sales Trend: Sales peaked in Aug–Sep 2019 (over $4M) and dropped to the lowest in May 2020 (~$1.5M). Profit Margin improved from negative in mid-2019 to positive (~1%) by late 2019 and remained stable through early 2020. Overall, sales fluctuate but show a downward trend after late 2019.

B, Profit Margin: Starts negative in mid-2019, improves significantly by Oct 2019 (close to 1%). Maintains near 1% through early 2020, slight dip in May 2020.

C, Insight: Profit margin recovery in late 2019 suggests operational improvements or cost control measures, even as sales declined slightly in 2020.

2, Sales by Country and Category
United States dominates sales ($20M), far ahead of other countries. Canada is second ($5M), followed by France, UK, Germany, and Australia (all under $3M). Category Contribution:

Bikes are the largest contributor in the U.S. Accessories and Clothing have smaller shares globally.

Insight: Heavy reliance on U.S. market; diversification could reduce risk.

3, Quantity by Category
Clothing: 33K units (highest). Bikes: 31K units. Components: 24K units. Accessories: 15K units.

Insight: Clothing leads in volume but likely lower revenue per unit compared to Bikes, which dominate revenue.

Key Observations
Seasonality: Strong sales in mid-2019, dip in early 2020—possibly due to external factors (economic slowdown, supply chain issues). Profitability: Margins improved despite sales volatility, indicating better cost management. Market Concentration: U.S. accounts for the majority of revenue; other regions contribute marginally. Product Mix: High-volume items (Clothing) may not drive revenue as much as high-value items (Bikes).
